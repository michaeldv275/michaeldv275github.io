My Github hosting for Website

This is a english proposed design for the customate.co.jp website.

Since the original website does not have much back-end programming like a database,
I opted to follow the original and not create any back-end programming programs for the website.

Since I'm no designer, nor a front-end web developer, I just used a template.
The design is based from the Lawfirm design obtained from freewebsitetemplates.com

The content of this proposal are mostly from my other English translation project
for the original Customate website.
